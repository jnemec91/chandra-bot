# ChandraBot

This is a Discord bot written in Python that utilizes the `discord` and `scrython` libraries to provide Magic: The Gathering (MTG) related functionalities. The bot can fetch card data, including prices, rulings, and card images, from the Scryfall API, and display them in Discord.
Additionally, it can replace mana symbols in text with Discord emojis.

## Features

- **Card Search:** Users can search for MTG cards by name, and the bot will return detailed information about the card, including its mana cost, type, oracle text, flavor text, and more.
- **Price Lookup:** Users can request the current prices of MTG cards in various currencies. The bot fetches this data from the Scryfall API.
- **Rulings Display:** Users can view the official rulings for MTG cards retrieved from Scryfall API.
- **Mana Symbol Replacement:** The bot replaces mana symbols in text messages with Discord emojis, adding them to the server if necessary.
- **Card Image Display:** Users can view the normal-sized card image for the requested MTG card.
